### Undergraduate Capstone Project

This capstone project involved developing a full-stack web application as a team. We had the freedom to choose our preferred programming language or framework. The project followed a Kanban board, with weekly sprints and meetings to ensure progress and collaboration. MySQL was a mandatory requirement for the database.

The application was required to include the following pages and functionalities:

* **Landing Page:** The initial page users encounter.
* **Register/Signup Page:** For new user account creation.
* **Login Page:** For existing users to access their accounts.
* **Reservation Page:** This page needed to display various room sizes and their corresponding prices, allowing users to make reservations.
* **Check-in Page:** For users to check into their reservations.
* **Check Reservation Page:** To view existing reservations.
* **Edit Reservation Page:** To modify existing reservations.

Additionally, the application needed to display specific images that were meaningfully integrated into the various pages.

An **Admin/Employee Login Page** was also required, allowing authorized personnel to view and manage customer/user information.
