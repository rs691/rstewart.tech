## Feature Update

>
 The project added functionality to the current tech stack, streamlining the parts selection process. It achieves this by integrating user-provided project data with live pricing catalogs, ensuring users have access to the most current cost information. This provides an efficient and intelligent solution for selecting parts and understanding their costs, ultimately contributing to more effective project management

The system architecture was intentionally designed to empower project managers with data-driven insights, facilitating optimized decision-making throughout the project lifecycle.

Furthermore, the tool enhances data analysis by merging stored project data with real-time pricing information. This integration significantly improves the accuracy of cost estimations.
