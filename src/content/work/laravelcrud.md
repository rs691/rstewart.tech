### IT Support Issue Tracker (CRUD Application)

This project involved the development of a full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using the Laravel framework. The primary objective was to create an efficient system for tracking and managing IT support issues. Key considerations during development included:

* **Efficient Issue Management:** The application provides a streamlined interface for creating new support tickets, viewing existing ones, updating their status, and deleting resolved or erroneous entries.
* **Laravel Framework:** Leveraging Laravel's robust features, the application benefits from its MVC architecture, routing, ORM, and templating engine, contributing to rapid development and maintainability.
* **Cloud Computing Principles:** Designed with scalability and deployment in mind, the application's architecture considers principles for deployment in cloud environments.
* **Server Development:** The backend was developed with best practices for server-side logic, database interactions, and API handling.
* **Security Principles:** Implementing essential security measures, such as input validation, authentication, and authorization, to protect sensitive IT support data and user accounts.

This application serves as a practical demonstration of building a complete web solution for internal IT support needs.
